        <p class="section-desc">To design a user-driven website, designers are mostly in a situation to design a container for future inputs, rather than designing a layout that marries a specific form to content. In this project, I explore web as a platform for dynamic contents,
            focusing on how designing the container could influence the future contents.</p>

        <h2 class="section-desc">After some feedback, I started contextualizing each input/output. I was struck by two ideas: the spiral art and the background time lapse. The spiral art has a huge significance in my religion and seemed like an interesting aspect to explore.
            Since I'm far away from home almost the entire year, I would often wonder how it would be if I was at home right now and browse through my pictures. I ended up making prototypes for each of them</h2>

        <h2 class="section-desc">In this project, I learned a lot about how to convey my mood in the form of webpages. The dynamic content for different inputs truly shapes the experiences of users. To have an immersive experience, the dimensions of an object can play a huge
            role.
